# Entitlement object

[!INCLUDE [2021_releasewave1](../includes/2021_releasewave1.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The entitlement object in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] describes which objects in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] a customer is entitled to use according to the license that they purchased or the role that they have in Microsoft Entra ID.

An entitlement consists of a number of [PermissionSet objects](devenv-permissionset-object.md) put together to constitute a set of meaningful permissions for a user. An entitlement can only include permission set objects, which reference the objects that are included within the same app. This is to ensure that the entitlements included with one app can't alter or redefine the entitlements included with another app. Being entitled defines the maximum permissions a user is entitled to. Actual permissions are the intersection between the permissions the user is entitled to and the permissions the user is assigned.

Entitlements can only be used with the online version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 2, entitlements can be used to support transactability for AppSource apps by binding entitlements to offers. For more information, see [Selling Business Central apps through AppSource](devenv-sell-apps-appsource.md).
<!--
> [!NOTE]  
> In the current version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] entitlements can only be included with Microsoft apps (enforced by the AppSource cop rules and the technical validation checks that we run for the apps submitted to AppSource). These objects will become available for the ISV apps when we introduce ability to monetize AppSource apps in one of our future releases.

## Snippet support

Typing the shortcut `tentitlement` creates the basic layout for an entitlement object when using the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] in Visual Studio Code.

[!INCLUDE[intelli_shortcut](includes/intelli_shortcut.md)]

## Entitlement example - delegated admin

This example illustrates a simple entitlement object with the [Type property](properties/devenv-type-property.md) set to `Role`, which means that the entitlement is associated with a Microsoft Entra role. When `Type` is set to `Role`, the [RoleType property](properties/devenv-roletype-property.md) is used to distinguish between local and delegated assignments of the role, in this case it's `Delegated`. The [ObjectEntitlements property](properties/devenv-objectentitlements-property.md) defines the list of permissions that the entitlement includes.

```al

entitlement "Delegated Admin agent - Partner"

{
    Type = Role;

    RoleType = Delegated;

    Id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000007';

    ObjectEntitlement = MyApp_PartnerFullAccessPermissionSet;

}

entitlement "Delegated Helpdesk agent - Partner"

{

    Type = Role;

    RoleType = Delegated;

    Id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000008';

    ObjectEntitlement = MyApp_PartnerFullAccessPermissionSet;

}

entitlement "Dynamics 365 Admin - Partner"

{

    Type = Role;

    RoleType = Delegated;

    Id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000009';

    ObjectEntitlement = MyApp_PartnerFullAccessPermissionSet;

}
```

## Entitlement example - per-user plan

An example of an entitlement where `Type` is `PerUserServicePlan`. This type is used to enable transactability for AppSource apps. The `Id` property is used to map the entitlement to the plan in Partner Center, and must contain the **Service ID** for the plan. For more information, see [Selling Business Central apps through AppSource](devenv-sell-apps-appsource.md).

```al
entitlement BC_PerUserServicePlan
{
    Type = PerUserServicePlan;
    Id = '1a2aaaaa-3aa4-5aa6-789a-a1234567aaaa';

    ObjectEntitlements = "D365 BASIC";

}
```

## Entitlement example - unlicensed

For scenarios when the user isn't licensed through entitlements mapping to AppSource offer plans, the `Unlicensed` type of entitlement is used. This type is used to enable custom licensing for an existing customer, or *side-by-side support*, for transactability-enabled apps on AppSource. For more information, see [Selling Business Central apps through AppSource](devenv-sell-apps-appsource.md).

```al
entitlement BC_Unlicensed
{
    Type = Unlicensed;
    ObjectEntitlements = "Custom license";
}

```

In the following code example, you can see how to check for entitlements in code.

### Entitlement example - testing for entitlements in code

```al
permissionset 50101 MyFreeLicensePermission
{
    Assignable = false;
    Permissions = table MyTable = X,
                  tabledata MyTable = R;
}

permissionset 50102 MyOfferLicensePermission
{
    Assignable = false;
    Permissions = tabledata MyTable = RMID;
    IncludedPermissionSets = "MyFreeLicensePermission";
}

entitlement BC_Unlicensed
{
    Type = Unlicensed;
    ObjectEntitlements = "MyFreeLicensePermission";
}

entitlement BC_PerUserOfferPlan
{
    Type = PerUserOfferPlan;
    Id = 'MyOfferPlan';
    ObjectEntitlements = "MyOfferLicensePermission";
}

...
procedure CheckingForEntitlementsUsingPermissions()
    var
        myTable: Record MyTable;
    begin
        if myTable.WritePermission() then
            message('User is entitled and has permission to write to MyTable => user is licensed')
        else
            if myTable.ReadPermission() then
                message('User is entitled and has permission to read from MyTable => user is unlicensed')
            else
                Message('User does not have permission to read from MyTable - we do not know if the user is licensed ');
    end;

    procedure CheckingForMyEntitlements()
    begin
        if NavApp.IsUnlicensed() then
            Message('User is assigned my BC_Unlicensed entitlement')
        else
            if NavApp.IsEntitled('BC_PerUserOfferPlan') then
                Message('User is assigned my BC_PerUserOfferPlan entitlement')
            else
                Message('This user is not assigned any of my entitlements, so this code will not run');
    end;

    procedure CheckingForOtherAppEntitlements()
    begin
        if (NavApp.IsEntitled('Delegated Admin agent - Partner', '63ca2fa4-4f03-4f2b-a480-172fef340d3f')) then
            Message('User is assigned the delegated admin agent entitlement defined in the system app: https://github.com/microsoft/BCApps/blob/main/src/System%20Application/App/Entitlements/DelegatedAdminagentPartner.Entitlement.al')
        else
            if (NavApp.IsEntitled('Dynamics 365 Business Central Essentials', '63ca2fa4-4f03-4f2b-a480-172fef340d3f')) then
                Message('User is assigned the essentials entitlement defined in the system app: https://github.com/microsoft/BCApps/blob/main/src/System%20Application/App/Entitlements/Dynamics365BusinessCentralEssentials.Entitlement.al');
    end;
...
```

## Entitlement example - Microsoft Entra group

An example of an entitlement where `Type` is `Group`. This supports scenarios when a user has to have access to the AppSource app with transact support and no need to buy a developer license. The `id` property is the object ID of the Microsoft Entra group. For more information, see [Selling Business Central apps through AppSource](devenv-sell-apps-appsource.md).

```al
entitlement BC_Group
{
    Type = Group;
    Id = '1a2aaaaa-3aa4-5aa6-789a-a1234567aaaa';
}
```

## Entitlement example - Microsoft Entra application access
An example of an entitlement where `Type` is `Application`. This supports scenarios when a vendor has to have access to the AppSource app with transact support and no need to buy a license. The `id` property is the client ID of the Microsoft Entra application. For more information, see [Selling Business Central apps through AppSource](devenv-sell-apps-appsource.md).

```al
entitlement BC_SpecificApplication
{
    Type = Application;
    Id = '1a2aaaaa-3aa4-5aa6-789a-a1234567aaaa';
}
```

An example of an entitlement where `Type` is `ApplicationScope`. This supports scenarios when it should be possilbe have Microsoft Entra application access to the AppSource app with transact support and no need to buy a license. The `id` property is the scope assigned to the Microsoft Entra application. For more information, see [Using Service-to-Service (S2S) Authentication](../administration/automation-apis-using-s2s-authenticationdevenv-sell-apps-appsource.md).

```al
entitlement BC_ApplicationWithAPIRWScope
{
    Type = ApplicationScope;
    Id = 'API.ReadWrite.All';
}

entitlement BC_ApplicationWithAutomationScope
{
    Type = ApplicationScope;
    Id = 'Automation.ReadWrite.All';
}
